# Learning Tensorflow

This tutorial was created for learning tensorflow by example

# Examples

## Neural Networks
A variety of tensorflow network implementations for MNIST, and CFAR-10 datasets

###MNIST
- [Basic Neural Network](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/mnist/basic-net.py) - A simple (single layer preception) network for classifying MNIST dataset
- [Multi-layer Neural Nework](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/mnist/mlp-net.py) - A simple (muli-layer preception) nework for classifying MNIST dataset
- [Convolutional Neural Nework](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/mnist/conv-net.py) - A convolutional nework for classifying MNIST dataset 

###CIFAR-10
- [Basic Neural Network](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/cifar/basic-net.py) - A simple (single layer preception) network for classifying CIFAR-10 dataset
- [Multi-layer Neural Nework](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/cifar/mlp-net.py) - A simple (muli-layer preception) nework for classifying CIFAR-10 dataset
- [Convolutional Neural Nework](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/cifar/conv-net.py) - A convolutional nework for classifying CIFAR-10 dataset
