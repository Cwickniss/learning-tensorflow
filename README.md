# Learning Tensorflow

This tutorial was created for learning tensorflow by example. Currently this repo contains examples for a simple single-layer neural network, multi-layered perception neural network, and convolutional neural networks. Tensorflow implementations function with a variety of data sets.

# Examples

## Neural Networks
A variety of tensorflow network implementations for MNIST, and CFAR-10 datasets

### MNIST
- [Basic Neural Network](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/mnist/basic-net.py) - A simple (single layer preception) network for classifying MNIST dataset
- [Multi-layer Neural Nework](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/mnist/mlp-net.py) - A simple (multi-layer preception) network for classifying MNIST dataset
- [Convolutional Neural Nework](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/mnist/conv-net.py) - A convolutional network for classifying MNIST dataset 

### CIFAR-10
- [Basic Neural Network](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/cifar/basic-net.py) - A simple (single layer preception) network for classifying CIFAR-10 dataset
- [Multi-layer Neural Nework](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/master/examples/cifar/mlp-net.py) - A simple (multi-layer preception) network for classifying CIFAR-10 dataset
